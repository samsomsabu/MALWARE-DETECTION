# Android Malware Detection from App Permissions

## Introduction and Motivation

Android has supported multiple 3rd-party app stores for years, and a recent court ruling will soon force Apple to support this too, giving users more choices. However, 3rd-party app stores may contain more malware or nefarious apps due to less strict vetting processes.

Whether this is true or just hyperbole, it would greatly benefit smartphone users if an app could be predicted as malware or benign before downloading it, based purely on the permissions that the app requests (e.g., access to pictures and media, microphone, etc.).

## What is Malware?

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. It can take various forms, such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. Malware can compromise the security, privacy, and functionality of the infected systems.

## Dataset Background

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains information on approximately 30,000 apps classified as either malware or benign, along with the permissions they require. The dataset includes additional attributes such as:

- App title
- Description
- Number of reviews
- Star review rating
- Price

However, the classifier developed in this project is designed to work purely based on the permissions requested by the app. This ensures that the model can be used "in a vacuum" and be effective even for the first user who downloads the app.

The permissions data was extracted using a tool called Apk Analyzer. The dataset consists of 184 columns of data, including:

- Class label (malware or benign)
- App title
- Package name
- Category
- Description
- Rating
- Number of reviews
- Price
- Related apps

For the purposes of this project, all columns except for the permission flags were excluded, resulting in a dataset with 173 features used for training and inference. Most of these features are binary flags, except for:

- Dangerous permissions count (integer)
- Safe permissions count (integer)

To avoid bias and ensure the model's applicability to new apps, these two features were also excluded, leaving only the raw boolean permission flags.

## Dataset Summary

- Total number of apps: 29,999
- Malware apps: 20,000
- Benign apps: 9,999
- Total features used for training and inference: 173 (permission flags)


## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the dataset.
3. Train the machine learning model using the training script.
4. Use the trained model to classify new apps based on their permissions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using app permissions to predict whether an Android app is malware or benign. By focusing on permissions alone, the classifier can provide early warnings to users about potentially malicious apps, helping to enhance the security of their devices.
